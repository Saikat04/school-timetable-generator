1. To see who can teach at a specific time of a day, I need to keep track of when one teacher is free.
2. I will take an boolean array of size 30 for each teacher as 30 can be the max. teaching hour for a teacher. Day 1 : 5 and period 1 : 6, if a techer is teaching some classes to a specific Day and specific period make busy[Day * Period] = true of that teacher

Extreme Bruteforce for assigning the teachers to each class
3. Take a map for each class where the key is the subject, and the value is no. of hours the course has been taught
4. Go to a class and take a subject if the value of that subject less than no. of periods required and check 
    if any teacher of that subject is free or not, if free mark the working hour of that teacher equals to true and increase the taught hour for that subject +1
    else goto the next subject and repeat the above if conditions
repeat the above conditions, until the values of each subject in the map not equal to specified no. of periods required.

repeat this processes for each class until all the values in course map reach to specified no. of hours in class_subject_periods
